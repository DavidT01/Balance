**Balance Plugin** made for game **Counter-Strike 1.6** using **Pawn**. Plugin is made for and used by **Fatality Family | Public (*91.218.66.83:27015*)**, main server owned by **<a href="http://www.fatality-cs.info/forum/index.php">Fatality Family Community</a>**.

Plugin handles:
- Joining and switching team restrictions and regulations.
- Special commands for admins (`/spec` and `/back`)
- Custom balancing algorithm that calculates player scores using in-game statistics (such as kills, deaths, multi-kill count, damage, etc) and balances teams to make the average team score difference between them as least as possible.
